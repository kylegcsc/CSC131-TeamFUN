How to solve conflicts

 

Part 2)  Working as a team:

1. Select one team member as the Git master of your group. The master needs to create a repository, and add your teammates and the instructor (jagannadha.chidella@csus.edu) as "Collaborators" in the "Settings" tab. (All members excluding the master will receive an email from Git, which informs you that you have been added to the master's repository.) 

2. All members clone the repository created by the master in your Eclipse.

3. All members create a java project named "Lab02" in your Eclipse, and link it to your local git repository. 

4. The master downloads Hello.javaPreview the document, add it to your Lab02 project in Eclipse. Update line 8 with his/her information, then save, commit, push the change to Git.

5. Everyone else (excluding the master) pull the latest change from Git, which is the java file just added by the master.

6. Everyone else tries to update line 9 in Hello.java with their own information. Save and commit to their local repository.

7. Everyone else try to push the index (your updates in your local repository) to Git, resolve conflicts if needed. To resolve a conflict, you will need to keep the information added by your teammates, by adding your line 9 as a new line underneath the latest line added by your teammates to Hello.java. (Do NOT erase other teammates' lines when resolving a conflict.)

8. When everyone finish, the master checks Git repository, and see whether Hello.java include all team member's information in it. If not, ask your teammate(s) to push their changes.
